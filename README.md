# Usability Evaluation and Prototyping (again)
> Usability Evaluation in this assignment is to evaluate your high-fidelity interactive-prototype with two participants:
> the participant from the previous Contextual Inquiry (CI) 
> and an additional novice-participant with different demographics if possible.
> Respectively, revise your prototype as an attempt to fix any problems found in this Usability Evaluation.

## Operating the Prototype
> Record a video (screen-recording is preferred) while you operating your prototype.
> Present the ideal case on how to interact with the prototype from the beginning to the end.
> Upload the video on any video-sharing website (e.g., YouTube), then attach the video link on this report.

Here is how we supposed to use the prototype:

## Part A: Usability Evaluation
> In this part, you should prepare your high-fidelity interactive-prototype from the assignment 2.
> Invite the participant from your previous CI to test the prototype.
> You also need to invite one more novice participant.
> As with the CI, you might need to videotape your sessions.
> You can benefit from the videotape while writing your `Recording Transcript` later.

### 1. Brief Description of Participants
> Describe your participants in bullets or sentences.
> The description should contain their demographic (age, gender, occupation),
> their skill level in using the system, and your reasons choosing them.
> The description should NOT contain any personally identifiable information.

#### a. Description of Participant 1
 - A male student
 - 20 years old
 - Study at ITS, Department of Chemistry
 - Medium level of IT knowledge
 - Reason: I have difficulties to reach the person from first CI, so I have to use new person for both test.

#### b. Description of Participant 2
 - A male person
 - 22 years old
 - Alumni of ITS, Department of Material engineering, just freshly graduated
 - Lower-medium level of IT knowledge
 - Reason: I have difficulties to reach the person from first CI, so I have to use new person for both test.

### 2. Evaluation Script
> Write the questions you ask and the instructions you use to direct the participants on what to do.
> If it is the same as previous assignments, please mention this, yet go ahead and INCLUDE it again,
> so we have everything in one place.
> Note that the evaluation script must include exactly what you plan to say to the participants.

Because both of the participant doesn't participate the first CI, so I have to include some introduction to the old version of the site.

Here is the instruction that I give to each participant (not in particular order in actual inquiry):
* Introduction section
    * I have a forum thread from forum.doom9.org opened, try to read the content.
    * Try to find search menu.
    * Try to navigate through pages.
* Main section
    * I have a prototype opened, try to read the content.
    * Try to find search menu.
    * Try to navigate through page.

### 3. Transcript
> Provide a summary of what the participant did and said, and what you did and said.
> If at some points you have to help the participants, because they cannot figure out what to do,
> that scene must be included in the transcript.
> It is not necessary to write down every word the participant said,
> just what is interesting and useful.
> Ensure to write down all the actions on the device, whether correct or wrong.
> Remember to supplement the transcript with time-codes or line-numbers.

#### a. Transcript with Participant 1
 1. **You**: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
 2. **Participant**: Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.
 3. **You**: when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
 4. **Participant**: The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.

#### b. Transcript with Participant 2
 - **00:01** 👨‍🔬 You: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
 - **00:10** 👨‍💻 Participant: Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.
 - **00:17** 👨‍🔬 You: when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
 - **00:25** 👨‍💻 Participant: The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.

### 4. Feedback and Incidence Analysis
> Record your observations per prototype screen followed by reference, feedback, incidence, reason, and resolution.

#### OBSERVATION 1
![Prototype Screen 1](https://www.europassitalian.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bravolol-app-screenshot-1-635x1128.png)

 - **Reference**: Provide line-number(s) or time-code(s) referred by feedback/incidence observed on the screen.
 - **Feedback**: Provide feedback (positive or negative) given by the participants, if any.
 - **Incidence**: Critical incidences (breakdowns or problems encountered by the participants) and/or mistakes committed by the participants, if any.
 - **Reason**: Explain the reason for the breakdowns or the negative feedback observed on the screen.
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 1`.
 
#### OBSERVATION 2
![Prototype Screen 2](https://www.studiainitalia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/free-courses-Learn-Italian-Online.jpg)

 - **Reference**: 
 - **Feedback**: 
 - **Incidence**: 
 - **Reason**: 
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 2`.
 
#### OBSERVATION 3
![Prototype Screen 3](https://www.jbklutse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/language-learning-apps.png)

 - **Reference**:  
 - **Feedback**: 
 - **Incidence**: 
 - **Reason**: 
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 3`.
 
 ... and so on ...

## Part B: Prototyping (again)
> Next, you will need to modify your prototype 
> based on the resolutions you have suggested in `Feedback and Incidence Analysis`'s observations.

### Sketch
> Draw a sketch of your prototype that is refined based according to the aforementioned observations on a paper.
> Afterwards, scan the sketch or make the photograph of it and attach it on this report's section.
> Please make sure the any texts on the sketch are readable.

### Design Rationale
> Please write a paragraph expressing what you have learned from the usability evaluation, 
> and how it is reflected in your design.

### High-Fidelity Interactive-Prototype
> Create a high-fidelity interactive-prototype based on the `Sketch` you have drawn.
> You can use any prototyping tools: InVision, Adobe XD, or even Microsoft PowerPoint.
